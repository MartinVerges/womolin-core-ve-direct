# WomoLIN.core module 

This module is meant to bridge VE.direct to MQTT.

# Installation

Clone the repository to your Raspberry pi and execute the following commands:

```
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. \
 && cmake --build . -j $(nproc) \
 && cmake --install .
```

Please edit the file `/etc/default/womolin-ve2mqtt` to fullfill your needs.
Usually you should set a topic as well as the right MQTT address.

Now to enable your service, make sure that you know the correct serial port and execute the command:

```
systemctl enable ve2mqtt@ttyS0
```
_Note_: In my example, my Ve.Direct device is connected on /dev/ttyS0 (serial port 1)._

## Serial Ports of the Raspberry Pi

If you want to connect multiple Victron Energy ve.direct devices to the RPi, you have to enable additional UARTs.
Depending on the model, you have up to 5 UART Serial Ports available. 

Edit `/boot/config.txt` and add the correspondig dtoverlay for the desired port. 
```
# dtoverlay=uart1       # GPIO 14/15
# dtoverlay=uart2       # GPIO 0/1
# dtoverlay=uart3       # GPIO 4/5
# dtoverlay=uart4       # GPIO 8/9
# dtoverlay=uart5       # GPIO 12/13
``` 
_Note_: You have to reboot the RPi to apply this new configuration. Beware, it is GPIO not PIN.


# Running testdata instead of a ve.direct device

In order to feed test data into the process.
To do so, you have to start it up as follows:

```
export TEST_DATA=testdata/testdata-bmv712smart.txt
export TEST_MQTT_ADDRESS=192.168.254.2
export TEST_MQTT_TOPIC=vetestdata
export TEST_MQTT_USER=testuser
export TEST_MQTT_PASS=testpass
./ve2mqtt test
```

# Using it with Home Assistant

To use the data of the VE Direct devices in the best possible way from the MQTT in HomeAssistant, here is an example configuration.
Please put it into your `configuration.yaml` file.

```
